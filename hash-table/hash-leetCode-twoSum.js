// Write a function that takes an array of numbers (integers for the tests) and a target number. It should find two different items in the array that, when added together, give the target value. The indices of these items should then be returned in a tuple like so: (index1, index2).

// For the purposes of this kata, some tests may have multiple answers; any valid solutions will be accepted.

// The input will always be valid (numbers will be an array of length 2 or greater, and all of the items will be numbers; target will always be the sum of two different items from that array).

function twoSum(numbers, target) {
    let seen = new Map();
    for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
      let x = numbers[i], y = target - x;
      if (seen.has(y))
        return [seen.get(y), i];
      seen.set(x, i);
    }
